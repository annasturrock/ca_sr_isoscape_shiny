# Shiny application showning California's Strontium Isoscape - database and map
To develop our capability for tracking fish movements around freshwater habitats in the California Central Valley using otolith strontium isotopes, we are developing a dynamic “isoscape” (map of Sr isotope variation in space and time). To build the map we have collected water samples, bivalve shells (primarily the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea - both wild and caged), and otoliths from known-origin salmon (primarily screw trap sampled juveniles, coded-wire tag juveniles sampled in the Delta and at the pumps, and coded-wire tagged adults recovered from carcasses on spawner surveys). 

The R code and associated Sr isotope data creates the Shiny app published here https://annasturrock.shinyapps.io/ca_sr_isoscape/

Note that this is a very early version of the website. The final version will be released alongside the QAQCed database and a peer-reviewed publication. If you wish to gain access to any of the underlying data before then please contact me directly at asturrock@ucdavis.edu.
